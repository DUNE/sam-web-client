v1_9:

All commands now accept a --timezone/-z option.
The file-lineage command will filter out retired files by default, and now has
a --showretired flag which displays them.
The file-checksum command can now read data from standard input by giving the
source argument as '-' (useful if the file you're interested in is not on local
disk, but has some way of dumping it to std out).

Bug #6893: Inconsistent exception handling
Bug #6900: file-lineage command doesn't filter retired files
Feature #6892: Send requested timezone information to server
Feature #6894: Allow file-checksum command to read from standard input
